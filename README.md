# VISIT LEON

## INTRODUCTION:

My website concept is to promote the city of Leon, a city proudly found in the North of Spain, and specifically the city to which I grew up in. Tourism is mainly focused on Portuguese and French tourists, however, there have recently been an increasing number of visitors from English speaking countries, like the United Kingdom and United States of America. Noticeably, there aren’t as many touristic materials available in the English language, therefore, I decided to focus my attention for this project on designing a comprehensive visitors guide, thereby, listing all key features of the city and the so called “must-sees” and “must-haves” within the city of Leon. I have also chosen to include the “must-stays”, therefore, reducing the stress some tourists may experience when trying to find accommodation to book.

I think there is a strong need to provide an easier way for tourists to find key information on the city, therefore, helping them to make decisions during their visit, for example, where to stay, what to visit and what or where to have some wonderful local tapas, and this was my primary objective. Since tapas is part of the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Leon, and Spain in general, I wanting to promote this as much as possible in my website.

## DESIGN:

Initially I wanted it to be as intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to find all the information that would support a great stay in a beautiful part of Spain. 

When developing a style concept, I experimented with different designs and layouts. I then identified the following structure, which I initially designed on paper:

PLACE DESIGN PicTURE HERE!!

I thought it was important to have a very straightforward, and simple, menu on the right-hand side of the page, so that visitors could easily access all the content they needed with a quick click of the mouse. The menu also acts as a glossary, outlining the topics being presented.

I decided to apply the same colours throughout the three page of information, as I thought it was important to continue with the same style, thereby, enforcing a sense of continuity throughout my website branding.

I decided to apply blue font colouring to my titles and apply a lilac background to the whole page. Additionally, I incorporated the colour turquoise to underline the menu. The main reasoning behind this was so that the page remained striking and distinctive in form, and easily identifiable. I wanted to portray a sense of coolness and calmness throughout my design, and not add bold and brash colours. My aim was to create an experience which felt relaxing and chilling, which in essence matches the general vibe and feeling of the city as a whole.

I have included pictures of “must-sees” and “must-haves”, which gives great incite into what to expect, but by using partially visibility or long-range image captures, this gives opportunity for imagination. Tourists can then use this incite, however, the surprise factor when they actually see it with their own eyes will remain impactful.

## FEATURES:

- Visit: This section includes the most important monuments or places, the so called “must-sees” to visit within the city. The purpose of this section was to assist tourists in finding touristic highlights, which may be of interest to them. This also facilitates and supports tourists in seeking out and gathering more information through the provided links. Whenever I visit a new place, I immediately check-out key sites to visit, and I wanted this to be a fundamental element to my website for its users.

- Eat: The section explores the cultural elements of the city to its fullest. A selection of the most well-known tapas bars in the city are on show here, promoting the “must-haves” in local cuisine. The purpose of this page is to provide tourists with a general understanding of what true tapas looks like, so that they may have greater understanding of what-to-eat and what-to-expect when visiting some of the amazing bars on offer throughout the city.

- Sleep: With any tourist guide, providing a list of the most popular hotels within a city can instil a sense of confidence in visitors. When being a tourist in another country myself, I like to book based on recommendation and official promotions. The purpose of this page is to assist tourists in choosing the most suitable placed hotel to stay, based on its location, their price expectation and any specific commodities that may be of necessity to them.

## TECHNOLOGIES:

- HTML has been utilised to create the all important content, which then supports the overall website structure you see.
- CSS is used to apply styling to the website pages.
- Git was used to apply version control to my project.
- Google Fonts to import all types of fonts, therefore, making my website impactful and exciting.
- Font Awesome to import icons to support social media links.

## TESTING:

I have completed rigorous and continuous testing after each and every change made, for example, when testing all external and internal links, and also when sizing and positioning all the included pictures. This allows me to guarantee that everything remains cohesive and well balanced throughout the page.

I used web developer tools to ensure the website was responsive to user interaction and W3C Validator to ensure there were no concerning errors on HTML and CSS. This was vital as the website could suffer significant inoperability when launched, thereby, substantially affecting user experience.

I have tested the website on different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and all have generated very positive results.

## BUGS:

Unfortunately, the photos I have used to create the title bar doesn’t adjust to a phone screen size in the way I was expecting it to. It appears too wide, therefore, the full image cannot be seen in its fullest form. Following mentors guidance, I could improve this, however, not to the extent I had envisaged in the first place. I need to obtain further training or conduct additional knowledge development in this area.

## DEPLOYMENT:

I have hosted the project on github pages, which can be accessed through:


## REFERENCES:

I used Wikipwedia and specific webpages for all the hotels, bars and tourist information.
I used pixabay.com and latabernadegaia.com for most of the pictures.
