#VISIT LEON

INTRODUCTION: 
My website is about the city of Leon in Spain. I have thought of an easy way to find key information that any tourist may need, like where to stay, what to visit and what or where to have some tapas, since tapas is part of the culture and lifestyle of their inhabitants.

DESIGN:
It is intuitive, clean and easy to find all the information.
I thought of an straightforward menu on the right so visitors can easily access the content needed.
Colors are the same in the three files to continue with the style. Titles are blue with a lylac background and a distintive turquise underline for the menu, in order to easily identify it.
Pictures of buildings are descriptive but leave place to imagination so tourists can have the surprise factor once they can see it with their own eyes.

FEATURES:
-Visit: Includes the most immportant monuments or places to visit in the city. The purpose is that the tourist can not only find all the options available that can be of their interest and organise their time accordingly, but also to gather more information through the links.
-Eat: Has a selection of most well-known tapas and bars in the city.The purpose is the the tourist can have a general understanding of what having tapas is, so can know what to eat or what to expect in some of the bars of the city.
-Sleep: Provides a list of the most popular hotels in the city. The purpose is that the tourist can choose the most suitable place to stay based on location, price and commodities that they may be of their necesity.

TECHNOLOGIES:
-HTML to provide the content and the structure.
-CSS to style the pages.
-Git for version control.
-Google Fonts to import fonts.
-Font Awesome to import icons for social links.

TESTING:
I have done continuous testing after any change made, such as testing all external and internal links, or size and position of the pictures.
I used the web developer tools to ensure the website was responsive and W3C Validator to ensure there were no errors on HTML and CSS.
I have tested it on the different browsers Chrome, Firefox and Safari with positive results.

BUGS:
Unfortunately the photos for the title doesn't adjust to the phone screen the way I was expecting it, which means it is too wide, therefore, the full image cannot be seen 100%. Following the tutor's guidance I could improve it but not to the intention I had in first place. More training and further knowledge are required.

DEPLOYMENT:
I have hosted the project on github pages, it can be accessed through:
