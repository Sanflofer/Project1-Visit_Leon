          You can easily have lunch/dinner with just tapas. As a rule of thumb, 5-7 tapas are more than enough!

          A piece of advice, please be careful how much you drink, otherwise you may end up being a little tipsy.

          The Barrio Húmedo and the Barrio Romántico are the two most famous neighbourhoods, nonetheless, Picara Square and Junta De Castilla Y Leon districts are very enjoyable too.
